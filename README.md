### Where does the name *"shamo"* come from?
The name *"shamo"*, pronounced [ʃɑ:mɔ:], stands for *"Stochastic HeAd MOdelling"*.

In french, it sounds like the word *"chameau"* which is the translation for *"camel"*. This is a reference to the bematists, those ancient greek and egyptians who were able to measure distances with a high accuracy by counting the steps of a camel. They were involved in the accurate calculation of the circumference of the Earth by limiting distance measurement errors.

As did the old bematists, this tool aims at raising the accuracy in outcome of neuro- studies by providing more insights on the errors involved.
